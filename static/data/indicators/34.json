The use of national financial reporting means that donors do not impose additional requirements on governments for financial reporting. The use of national auditing procedures means that donors rely on the audit opinions issued by the country's supreme audit institution and on the government's normal financial reports/statements. Government sector aid includes aid disbursed in the context of an agreement with administrations (ministries, departments, agencies or municipalities) authorized to receive revenue or undertake expenditures on behalf of central government. This is part of the 2011 Monitoring Exercise on Development Effectiveness in the Education Sector, an unprecedented picture of aid effectiveness in the education sector that can be used as the basis for in-country dialogue and debate going forward.

Three tools were used to collect this data: the Ministry of Education Questionnaire and the Donor questionnaire for quantitative data, and an Explanatory Note for qualitative data. The GPE Secretariat worked closely with Local Education Groups (LEGs ) to collect, process, produce, review and validate this information; and the Coordinating Agency or lead donor was tasked to coordinate the exercise with the LEG and to work with the Ministry of Education.

PBA is a way of engaging in development co-operation based on the principles of coordinated support for a locally owned programme of development, such as a national education plan. Programme-based approaches share the following features: Leadership by the host country; a single comprehensive programme and budget framework; a formalized process for donor coordination and harmonization of donor procedures; efforts to increase the use of country systems. This is part of the 2011 Monitoring Exercise on Development Effectiveness in the Education Sector, an unprecedented picture of aid effectiveness in the education sector that can be used as the basis for in-country dialogue and debate going forward.
